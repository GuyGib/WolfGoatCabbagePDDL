Domain And Problem PDDLs


PDDL-Planning Domain Definition Language 
 is an attempt to standardize Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning languages.
 
 By defining a domain which containing the set up of the problem and the goal of the problem.
 
 in the Problem file we define which actions our machine can use to get to the goals.
 
 The Planner that I used for this:http://solver.planning.domains/solve
